# Chess Engine & Analysis Project

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Packages: see requirements.txt

----

## 1. Play Chess against the CNN model

You can play a chess game from the Terminal against the CNN model engine.

To play the Chess Game,
Run in Terminal:
python -m src.engine.ui

--

For more details, see the documentation in src/engine/ui.py.
The CNN model is implemented in src/ml/cnn_model.py, the training pipeline
is in src/ml/cnn_train.py, and the feature encoding that turns chess
positions and moves into X and y is in src/ml/features.py.

----

## 2. Generate analysis & figures

You can build all diagrams that are in folder 'figures'

Run in Terminal:
python run_all.py
python src/ml/ml_train.py

----

## 3. Train the CNN model

# Option A:
If you have GPUs on your computer,
Run in Terminal:
python src/ml/cnn_train.py

# Option B:
You can train the model with Google Colab GPUs like that:
1. Extract "Google Colab Package.zip" from Project.
2. Inside you’ll find a folder "chess" and a notebook file "chess.ipynb".
3. In Google Drive, upload the entire chess folder to the root (MyDrive).
4. Open the notebook "chess.ipynb" in Google Colab.
5. Enable GPU (in Colab) go to Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator: GPU → Save.
6. Run the notebook (Permit this notebook to access your Google Drive files? Yes).
